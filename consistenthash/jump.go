package consistenthash

// Jump consistent hash also does a better job of splitting the keys evenly among the buckets,
// and of splitting the rebalancing workload among the shards.
// On the other hand, jump consistent hash does not support arbitrary server names,
// but only returns a shard numberÍ¾ it is thus primarily suitable for the data storage case.
